	 * element containing the reference is lost to deeper calls.  In Project, this element is needed because
	 * only definitions that appear BEFORE the reference are in scope.
	 *
	 * @param context the element from which an element shall be referenced. It doesn't need to be the element
	 * 		  containing the reference, it is just used to find the most inner scope for given {@link EReference}.
	 * @param reference the reference for which to get the scope.
	 * @param originalContext the original element from which an element shall be referenced.  This IS the
	 * 	element containing the reference.
	 * @return {@link IScope} representing the inner most {@link IScope} for the
	 *         passed context and reference. Note for implementors: The result may not be <code>null</code>.
	 *         Return <code>IScope.NULLSCOPE</code> instead.
